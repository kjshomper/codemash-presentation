## Evolution of a RESTful Testing Framework
### Increased Productivity on APIs for the Whole Team

RESTful APIs are becoming ubiquitous in today’s digital world.  The Programmable Web now boasts over 18K APIs in it’s directory and the pace of publishing is accelerating.  Every organization will need to provide or use REST APIs.  Whether your team is a backend resource or API provider, client app development team, or you live in between these two as a proxy, you would benefit from a robust test framework.  This session opens with a brief overview of the API landscape and unfolds the evolution of a test framework.  Developed initially for API proxy developers, who needed simple, scripted, headless REST call and validation while maintaining client state; its execution model expanded for improved decoupling of API calls and asserts, API independence from client/provider, and dev/run perspectives.  The concepts presented are applicable whether you choose to ‘roll your own’ solution or extend an existing REST testing client like Postman.
